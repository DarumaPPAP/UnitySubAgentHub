# UnityArtistCLI 0.0.1-beta

UnityArtistCLI 0.0.1-beta moves the current product from the old MCP-first MyUnityMCP surface to an official Unity CLI + Unity Pipeline Artist specialist.

## Production surface

- `unity-artist` host CLI with structured human/JSON/NDJSON output
- LookDev, visual direction, lighting, environment, camera, capture, evaluation and refinement
- Timeline, Cinemachine Shot, track/clip/binding, marker/signal, activation/control/animation planning
- Explicit project binding, exact diff, expected revision, approval, Undo and Evidence lifecycle
- UnityAgent Provider id `unity_artist_cli` through the existing Runtime chain

## Current production support

- Unity 6.x+ + Built-in
- Unity 6.x+ + URP
- Unity 6.x+ + HDRP

Unity 2022.3 (all render pipelines), Unity 2023 and URP 14–16 are unsupported before mutation. The Unity 2022.3 Built-in bounded `unity run` fallback in `Tests/Compatibility/unity2022-3-builtin-bounded-fallback-evidence.yaml` is historical fixture evidence and is not an active production transport.

## Verification status

Host CLI build, structured envelopes, compatibility preflight and static contracts are covered. Unity 6000.6.0f1 Built-in direct Editor/Pipeline and UnityAgent Provider E2E passed in the disposable fixture; the evidence is recorded in `Tests/Compatibility/unity6-builtin-e2e-evidence.yaml`. Unity 6 URP/HDRP direct fixtures were verified. The 2022.3 Pipeline gate and bounded fallback results remain historical observations; they do not establish current support or fallback eligibility.

MyUnityMCP v1.1.1 and its immutable tag remain available as migration history under `Legacy/MyUnityMCP-1.1.1/`.
